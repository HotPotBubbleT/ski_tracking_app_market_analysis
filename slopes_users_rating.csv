True,Works on my iPhone 6 again!,"{'id': 12995985, 'body': 'Hey Starkiller, you can totally still use it with the 6 (since you previously downloaded it)! Apple just doesn\'t make that 100% clear how. In the App Store go to the Updates tab, and you\'ll see the ""Purchased"" option at the top. Hit that and find Slopes in the list. Apple lets you download older versions of apps as long as the developer approves it. I made sure to keep a version around for people on 12. I\'ve got ya covered. \n\nUpdate: I went ahead and put in a lot of work to retrofit iOS 12 support into Slopes, meeting your request to support one version older of iOS. Hope you enjoy all the new goodies!', 'modified': '2020-01-19T10:22:46Z'}",Starkiller67,5,"At the start of the ski season, I tried to use Slopes, but iOS had offloaded it since I hadn‚Äôt used it during the off-season. I couldn‚Äôt get it to download again and after several tries, finally discovered that it now only works on iOS 13 and up. The developer claims you can keep using the old version, but if you have to reinstall, you can‚Äôt get the old one back. Now switching to a competitor that still supports iOS 12. As a developer myself, it‚Äôs generally a good idea to support at least the previous iOS version.

Update: After the developer contacted me, I was able to reinstall an older version of the app. Apple did not make this easy to find. I added two more stars due to the developer‚Äôs prompt response. However, I would still like to see support for at least one iOS version back for new updates. Most apps I checked still support back to iOS 10.

Update 2: The developer supports iOS 12 again! Greatly appreciated and definitely noticed performance improvements and less battery drain. Thanks again for making this change!",2020-01-21 03:12:10
False,üî•üî•üî•,,K_Krum,5,"Fantastic app for any skiers/snowboarders looking to track their day on the slopes. The data the app gives even without the premium pass is still very cool and helpful. You can view your top speed, longest run length, a timeline of all lift rides and runs with an animation on a 2D map, etc. 

The premium pass somehow makes it 10x better, with precise lift and run times for each run, instantaneous speeds on any run, a 3D google-earth like view of your day on the slopes, a graph with your heart rate and speed along the timeline, and many other things that would take too long to list here. I would HIGHLY recommend this app, and if you can afford the premium pass, even just for a day or a single trip, I would also highly recommend it. 

The only issue I have had with the app is the last 90 min of one of my days not recording, which I think was due to me accidentally force closing the app; otherwise, it is absolute üî•. I almost never write reviews, but this app deserved my time. (Which should tell y‚Äôall something)",2020-02-25 03:51:57
False,What would Jesse Pinkman do?,,R.Perry,5,"I give a 5 star. I was gifted an Apple Watch for Christmas and have been recording as many days on snow as I can. (So far iv got 28 days, 258runs) I really enjoy being able to look back at my day and see each run, even with the free version. I am however very forgetful and sometimes forget to stop the recording and the app records my ride home as a result. I know I can edit those out with the features provided. I wish there was a way for the app to be able to recognize when iv left the resort, and am on main roads, so that an auto stop would activate and auto log while I‚Äôm driving. I get that that‚Äôs asking a lot for someone who‚Äôs lazy and just forgetting to simply hit stop, but i think, in my opinion, that it would make the app better. You‚Äôve already improved in so many ways since the 26th of dec. and I thank you for that! Thank you for a lock, the stop without pause, and the safety features for glade trials.",2020-02-05 04:24:43

This is weird as he has used it for years and it still has all the tracks logged, it's like they just didn't transfer to the friends section.  We don't know why his do not appear.  They don't appear on my app or his, but my stats do on both.  It's not a huge deal and we usually discuss our stats in person, however, it would be nice to see eachothers and frankly it shouldn't have this issue in the first place.

All around a good app with some cool features. I‚Äôm not a premium subscriber yet as my main riding partner is in a cast and I won‚Äôt be going to any big resorts this year, but I am looking forward to using my day pass to try out the features. 

My one complaint, and this may just be with my Watch itself, is that the Siri integration for Slopes doesn‚Äôt work on it. I say ‚Äúhey Siri, start snowboarding‚Äù and the Fitness app pops up. It works fine on my phone, but not on the Watch. Like I said, could be a Watch thing, but I would like the ability to use voice control confidently.

False,"Amazing on any device, paid or free, any trip!",,Pirkchoperer13,5,"Okay, so I've had this app for about 6m and today I finally got to use it as I haven't been out on the slopes. This app is simply amazing. Not only is it great on Apple Watch. Old iPhones (tried on IPhone 5), and new iPhones, but it's also very accurate on all of them. It got my exact times (times Myself with atop watch) shows you any wipeouts, slowdowns, speeds, and everything you cAn think of. It shows you very single run in 3D mode, and even a satellite view of the mountain, showing exactly on the trail you were at, showing all your turns. That one is a paid feature, but with all the amazing paid features I recommend getting a one day pass. I don't ski often, so it's totally worth it. If you ski at least twice a week, maybe get a liger pass. It's amazing for casual skiing for a hobby like myself, or if your a racer or comp skier. Would 1000% recommend.",2019-03-09 15:44:48
False,Could be Better,,NigerianPygmyGoats<3,3,"I love the app! It‚Äôs good, but there is a lot that can be improved. I would rate it more positively if there were reviews for every run. Let‚Äôs say, the top speed, distance, average speed, and time for every trail you ski or ride. Also, the time on the chairlift and lift line time (as well as other breaks) are added into your average speed. This doesn‚Äôt bother me much, but when comparing with friends who use other apps, I always have a speed of around 3 mph when they have averages of 24 mph. Some apps I‚Äôve used (which have [sadly] been taken out of the App Store) recorded numbers of jumps and names of trails. When talking with friends today on the lifts, we decided that the app should totally show the names of the trails you skied and have trail maps readily available. Along with the maps, I always wished the app would show which trails were closed, and which chairlifts were running. Other than these suggestions, the app is great!! Though I have had better apps, this one is definitely at the top. üëç",2020-12-22 19:26:44
False,This app is god!,,DraxLF,5,"Just took this for a full day of sending with some friends and I really like this app. The speed tracker is wicked and I was super hyped when i broke 50mph. The mapping is also amazing, you can see each of the runs you did and the lifts you used. I was also amazing at just how far and high we skied. You would think that the gps recording and speed tracking takes a toll on your battery. It turns out it didn‚Äôt really at all! The app uses the gps and speed stats from the Apple health trackers and it‚Äôs relatively energy efficient. I started at 89% and on low power mode, with a bit of snap chatting and phone calling my phone dropped to only 56%. All in all I highly recommend this app. It‚Äôs made by one rad guy who wants to improve our days, which he definitely has. Also, everything I talked about is completely freeeee! So download this app and enjoy your adventure on the mountain.",2018-01-29 02:03:17
False,Just excellent,,Yorkshire exile,5,"I have had this application for several years now and have reviewed it several times, all at five stars but the developer keeps dropping new versions so it‚Äôs only fair to give it another review. It has proven to be even more useful to me since I updated my old series one Apple Watch to a current one, it‚Äôs now it‚Äôs so easy to turn on and off running app from the watch. I do like the feature just introduced oh and also resume since I generally forget to turn on again after pausing. Another very valuable recent feature is the ability to compare two seasons. I ski several days a week so this is very handy. besides all the amazing features perhaps a key reason to get slope is if you‚Äôre a skier is that the developer will quickly respond to any questions or issues that you have. Try that with some big company",2019-03-27 20:40:05
False,Great App,,Triangle.Tipz,5,"Wish I downloaded this app sooner. I always use Slopes because I thoroughly enjoy beating my last season stats. I also use it as my snow season diary. It‚Äôs awesome that the photos I took during my send is automatically attached to my day. I‚Äôve been digging the new features like being able to download maps for offline use and peer recorded weather updates. My only request would be that you can view a trail map of the resort as one of the map layer options when you view your run details. Right now you can only view in winter or satellite layer. I‚Äôve also noticed that some resort maps are only a portion of the resort and not the entire resort. Overall, I think it‚Äôs an awesome app and am grateful for all the new updates every season. My partner and I have been premium subscribers for 3 seasons now and we both think it‚Äôs totally worth it. Thanks Slopes app!!",2021-03-15 03:43:06
False,Great ski tracker,"{'id': 12680490, 'body': '""Simple matter"" - the devil is in the details ;). But, you\'re 100% spot-on with your request. Slopes focuses on alpine skiing right now, but I really want to improve the tracking algorithm I wrote to help me distinct skinning vs a lift so I can help with calorie counts much more accurately. Backcountry skiing is often ignored with tracking apps and I really want to see Slopes cover that.', 'modified': '2020-01-02T06:57:47Z'}",Pablopilot,5,"It‚Äôs hard to find fault with this app. I do have one request, which I‚Äôll lead with. Some of us hike to certain runs or off piste spots. Here at aspen Highlands, the Bowl is a daily ritual. Slopes tracks the hike perfectly, but seems to think it is a lift for calorie tracking purposes. I can assure you it is not. Since Slopes knows where all the lifts are, it would seem a simple matter to track this uphill high altitude trail. 

I love how accurate Slopes is. It captures every run perfectly, even the intermittent rest stops. The distances and speeds are great. The map of my ski day is fun. It helps me remember how many days I do what in a year, which I love. The real test will be in Japan later in the season, where on and off piste skiing is on tap. It would be nice if it tracked hiking (and skinning) separately for what it is, rather than lumping it into the lazy uphill category. 

Great app!",2019-12-31 23:11:22
False,Stop looking another tracking app and get Slopes,,TimmyT11,5,"TL;DR get Slopes if you are interested in any sort of ski/snowboard tracking

This is the only ski/snowboard tracking app you will need. Once you download and try it you will be hooked. 

We used to only be able to know who got to the bottom of the run fastest, and just try our hardest to remember how many runs we did, did we ride Montezuma 3 or 4 times before lunch, I lost count. 

Not any more! Every stat you can think of is tracked, lift time and line time, actual riding time, speed, distance, altitude, runs, heart rate (with Apple Watch), gps map of your runs, 3D map of your runs, and some many others. Now you can see exactly how many runs you did and who is getting to a higher speed during the run! I was able to pinpoint exactly how fast I was riding when I crashed and dislocated my shoulder (39mph), but don‚Äôt tell my wife.

On top of the already awesome app, it keeps getting regular updates! I thought to myself, it would be great if the Apple Watch app tracked heart rate, not a month later it was added. Then I though it would be cool if you could see a graph of this, again a month later that feature was added. I don‚Äôt have any more ideas but I‚Äôm sure something else I love is coming.",2018-12-14 16:09:18
False,I love this app!,,Skichick47,4,"This is my third season using Slopes and I love all the information you can get on a free app. Not only does it break up your day to actual run time and lift time but it gives you average speed and allow you to pause for breaks. It is very easy to use and the support team is great! My only issue with the app is that the calories burned count is confusing to me since it is really high when I compare it to another calorie tracker that estimates calories for down hill skiing. On that app my 1 hr and six minutes of actual downhill ski time in 3 hours of being on the hill was 306 cal while slopes said I used over 518 calories. That is a big difference! Last year I spoke  with Kelly on the support team to try to understand it and She said they would work on it but it hasn‚Äôt changed. Except for that one thing which may not matter to many, it does exactly what I need it to do.",2020-12-14 17:28:54
False,Best ski tracking app!,,ImUrPropofol,5,"I‚Äôve used another ski tracker (Ski Tracks)for a long time, 7-8 years now.  It was very good, but Slopes is even better. 

It does an excellent job of tracking runs even if you don‚Äôt have a paid subscription. But, the price of admission is totally worth it for what you get. The detailed run stats and 3D maps make for reviewing the days activities very easy and fun. The mapping is even better than what I am used to from Ski Tracks. 

The Apple Watch integration is amazing - just start your tracking from the Watch at the beginning of your day and you‚Äôve always got detailed info on your wrist throughout the day....best of all it saves HR data so you can view that at the end of the day with your other stats.

What sold me on Slopes was the built-in integration with Strava. This is the only area that I would currently like to see some upgrades. After communicating with the developer, sounds like that is on Strava‚Äôs end. Currently some of the speed data doesn‚Äôt get linked properly, but the real important stuff like distance & vertical flow over nicely. 

All in all this is a very solid tracker, worth the paid price.  Pick it up before your next day out on the slopes!",2019-02-21 02:11:40
False,"Best ski tracker, no comparison",,Jbdavids,5,"Works flawlessly. So easy to use, if you go to a new mountain it knows where you are immediately. The data feels very accurate. It‚Äôs always within a few hundred feet of epic mix and while I have no way of verifying this I believe slopes to be more accurate. Running slopes all day in addition to music does not significantly affect my battery life. The 3D replay is awesome. It‚Äôs cool to see where you were in the trees or off piste when it‚Äôs not always obvious. I don‚Äôt think the calories burned is accurate as I‚Äôve gotten similar numbers if I‚Äôm on bumps vs groomers but this should be fixed with the new update if you use it with Apple Watch and hr. My only wish at this point would be for some sort of leaderboard. Either way this is the best ski tracker app there is.",2018-03-07 03:53:30
False,Nice ski tracker,,M5MPower,4,"I really like this app. It will track your runs, record your speed, elevation, vertical feet skied, etc.  It‚Äôs fun to see all your tracks at the end of the day. 

The reasons I gave it 4 stars are because: 1) when I started my slopes session on my Apple Watch, I wasn‚Äôt able to see any of my recorded tracks on my phone until I ended the session at the end of the day. With ski gloves and layers of clothing covering my watch it‚Äôs not easy to get to it. Anyway it‚Äôs a minor issue. I will have to remember to start my session with my phone. 2) the friends feature doesn‚Äôt really seem to work. I‚Äôve added a few of my friends I ski with also have slopes and while I can see them in my logbook, I can‚Äôt see them in the friends section. I only see myself listed with no one else. Also, when I first reviewed my day sking I could see my friends tracks as well as mine, however, that has since disappeared. 3) it‚Äôs more expensive compared to other ski trackers. It might be that other ski trackers are ad supported in which case I can understand the price difference. 

Lastly, for a future enhancement can you include a trails % grade I‚Äôm skiing on? Maybe the average grade and max grade?

Thanks for making this app. Looking forward to future enhancements.",2020-02-22 18:10:22
False,Outstanding app for snowsports enthusiasts,,esidarap,5,"Simply put: outstanding app.  From the wealth of stats that are collected to their presentation, Slopes is hands down the best app for tracking your feats of heroism in the mountains. 

There is so much happening behind the scenes that reveal the attention to detail. For example, the daily overview with a map of your progress breaks out runs vs lift rides. Fine, lots of apps do that. But Slopes shows you an elevation profile or your heart rate over time. And it even identifies the names of the lifts ridden! Small detail for sure, but still cool. 

Suggestions. 

1. The Apple Watch app UI is too delicate and dainty. I‚Äôd prefer to see number of runs as the largest number, not elapsed time.  It would be great if you could pick, say, three or four stats, each displayed in the largest possible format (for those of us that wear single vision contacts when riding the pow). 

2. The season log book shows elapsed time skiing or total time. But these only resolve to hourly significant figures. That‚Äôs too coarse. It should show hours and minutes.

3.  Would be awesome if the Apple Watch app could read your current stats aloud by tapping on the watch face or perhaps invoking Siri.",2021-02-10 05:02:36
False,Fantastic Ski Tracking App,,Nintendofan825,5,"I used this at Mt. Sunapee resort for the first time yesterday. The app is very polished and does exactly what it's supposed to. The Apple Watch version is also very good. I can tell the developer put a lot of thought and care into this project. The app tracks the amount of time you spent going downhill, riding the lift uphill, and resting. It will even estimate calories burned and add it to the Health app. The optional in app purchase model for advanced stats works well. You can use the app without purchasing a pass, but the price for a day is very reasonable and allows you to track more information about your day while supporting the developer for making this great app. I've used other ski tracking apps and this is the best I've used so far by a long shot.",2017-04-09 12:09:27
False,My top skiing priority,,Atheleticgirl01,5,"You might think I‚Äôm crazy that this is the first thing I think about when packing to ski, but it‚Äôs true. I love being able to see my stats and have them recorded for each season. I make sure my watch is charged for the night and start the app up every time I go to a resort. No cell service is required for the watch which is even more amazing to me.

If there was one upgrade that I think the app could use would be to label each run. You can edit them if it‚Äôs a run that was recorded as a lift or if you left it on while driving to get dinner. But I would like to name the runs as the resorts name them or so that my run # compares to my friends.

I couldn‚Äôt be happier with an app than I am with this one.",2021-01-23 17:14:30
False,Just keeps getting better,,Apple User 100000,5,"I don‚Äôt buy a lot of apps or have a lot of subscriptions - but the developer for Slopes just keeps on adding features and making improvements.  Works flawlessly with my Apple Watch, and my 2 kids have burner iPhones i put in their pocket to track their progress.  They like to check their stats at the end of the day.  There is now an SOS feature added which could come in handy but I hope I never need it.

Ive picked up some stickers also and will probably grab a Stealth Tee when i reach the stats marker - would have easily made it last season but it was cut short due to Covid. 

I highly recommend the app and subscription if you hit the mountain more than a couple times a year.",2020-12-25 00:20:53
False,Best Snow Sport App EVER,,Wolfe Neel,5,"Like when I say best I mean it. And get premium!!! Well worth the price. For a year me, my wife and daughter and three more people if I wanted, can track their skiing. (Or boarding if that‚Äôs u). Now I will say u may face glitches on first use. Like with us my first recording didn‚Äôt grab my heart rate. But that was because the setting option to allow the app to read and write data didn‚Äôt pop up until after the first recording. And my wife didn‚Äôt record at all. But she also started on her phone when she was wearing an Apple Watch. I started it on my watch. But I had her start on  the watch next time and both our settings updating to allow writing data. And worked perfectly since. Nothing is perfect. Especially with tech. But I‚Äôll be damned if this isn‚Äôt as close to perfect as u can get. 

The only two features I would luv to see one day: 
1. Being able to see full data on phone in real-time while recording on watch
2. Be able to do more with resorts like but passes, tickets and rentals. Cause then I would have all I need in one app that would be amazeballs. 

But keep up the good work y‚Äôall!!!",2021-02-17 01:51:38
False,Absolutely awesome!,,TsopiS,5,"Very nice application, giving you exactly what you need to log your rides. You can have a full day on the mountain, listening to music and play around without draining the battery, the accuracy is amazing and with the alerts you simply can‚Äôt forget to launch it! Bonus with notifications is that you get alerted even during summer when you are close to a slope so if you like hiking you can hike  around the pistes.
It would be awesome if you could locate other users in the same mountain using the app. It would also be great if you could export the daily runs on a video in order to be able to share the 3D view with friends even if they don‚Äôt use the app.

My kids actually look forward to the chair lift so we can look at the stats on our most recent run: how far, how high, and of course, how fast. If you love skiing, you'll love this app. 

Even better was the most recent update note about removing the Facebook hooks. It seems that every day there's yet another announcement about FB abusing or leaking our personal data, so I'm really happy to see that this developer is taking steps to distance the app (and all of its users) from ""that creepy company"".

I've tried several apps in the last few month and then I cam across Slopes! If you have a cellular Apple Watch this is the only thing you'll need, It doesn't need a phone in order to work. This provides you with all the stats you'd need while riding. It even has the ""Lock"" feature built into the UI, so there's no accidental touches or pauses while riding.

False,small developer = BIG DELIVERY/EPIC APP,,timcmillan,5,"There is not enough praise in the world to adequately justify how epic this app is. We all use multiple apps daily for every aspect of our lives. We know how difficult it can be to suggest improvements to these big app developers and get around the bugs and useless features. Not Slopes. This app just works. 
This is honestly the only app on my entire phone that I get excited to open and use. The amount of detail that goes into this app is astonishing. It is super user friendly and I show it off to all my friends. This makes skiing that much more enjoyable off the slopes. I open the app and start recording at the beginning of the day and close it after my last run. Then, when I get home, I get to relive the time on the mountains with the statistics/data and the interactive map. 

This app gives me hope for new developers and specifically the small ones. You don‚Äôt need to be a multi million dollar corporation to build a beautiful app. Just a hard working, passionate person. 

Thank you Slopes for being the most epic app I have ever used. Can‚Äôt wait to ski again.",2020-01-07 16:39:21
False,Fantastic App,,BC Buz,5,"This is the premier app for skiers & snowboarders. What really wowed me was all the stats that Slopes gathers. At the end of the day we have total feet of vertical, number of runs, lift time, ski time, top speed, average speed and Slopes accumulates all this data and displays the data in a number of different ways, all of which are practical to review your numbers. 

I have tried a number of ski tracking apps, none compared to Slopes, but I have been able to transfer the data from the previous apps right into Slopes. 

Any issues I had and the developer responded within a day and got me back on track. I hope to keep adding vertical to my stats. I‚Äôm in my 70s and I can‚Äôt believe my mileage, vertical & speed. 

If you‚Äôre not tracking your ski days you are missing out on a lot of helpful information.

Top speed: 50.5 MPH
Biggest daily vertical: 39,099
Biggest daily distance:  40.0 miles
724 runs in 75 days, skiing a total of 1,087.3 miles and 1,155,661 feet downhill, 3 resorts.

False,It‚Äôs simple!,,JabberboxJake,4,"Giving this 4 stars only because I don‚Äôt have premium and I can‚Äôt rate the other features. I‚Äôve only used this for one day on the mountain and it was awesome! The app is super simple to understand, super easy to use and I don‚Äôt have to worry about pausing the app for lifts and remembering to resume. If anyone is considering this app I highly recommend it, it‚Äôs pretty cool to not check it until the end of the day to see your stats. Bragging to your friends about your top speed or comparing how fast you can do a run is all super fun. The map that shows your runs is super cool because you can see side trials you took and save it for later. Honestly there‚Äôs just so much to love about the app and I can‚Äôt wait to use it the rest of the season!",2020-01-06 03:33:32
False,Love it!,,Caberfae Chad,5,"The premium  pass adds another level of enjoyment to my snowboarding life. Objective and accurate information about my time spent on the hill along with the ability to look back in time to compare and remind oneself of past adventures make this app my favorite. 
While I don‚Äôt ‚Äúshare‚Äù info at this point I can see the value that this feature adds.
I especially like the abilty to delete runs/lifts for those days that I forget to turn off the app until I am home and only then realize that my drive back the cabin was included in my recording. Simple fix now to remove that from my stats.

Features that are awesome? It tracks your runs in 3D, the independent Developer has implement some impressive augmented reality features.  This thing runs (ski) laps around the competition and I use it to track every run.  The integration with Strava is awesome.   It also always knows how to match where I am.

I‚Äôve used it twice and the second time, the app was not able to find my mountain when I was setting up (GPS signal issues, I think) but it found the resort when I closed the session for the day and still did a nice job of overlaying my runs on the 3D map.

False,Awesome App!,,Zag1000,5,"My family and I use Slopes and we love it.  The App is easy to use and is pretty accurate for tracking and speed.  My family does Apple family share, and we had an issue early in the season with only me being able to buy a Slopes season pass.  I couldn‚Äôt share the pass either.  I reached out to development and was contacted within 12 hours and my wife and son had the season pass on their phones the next day.  So not only a awesome app, but A++ customer support.

I got this app specifically for tracking my speed and discovered so many other perks! I love watching every time I go down a slope on the map and seeing what every run is like. 
If I could make a change it would be to zoom in on the map of the trails. It can look so small and the likes can jumble together but it‚Äôs not a huge deal.

Pros:
- easy to use with just the features you need. Not a bunch of extra features that bog the app down that aren‚Äôt useful anyway. 
- even our small ski resorts in North Carolina showed up with up-to-date maps. 
- the tracking appears to work flawlessly. 
- we used the app to check speed and number of runs mostly which it made easy. 
- there are benefits of creating an account but I don‚Äôt think you even have to for this app. The problem with most of these apps is that half the group won‚Äôt download it because they don‚Äôt feel like making an account, signing up for monthly subscriptions, etc.... that is not the case for this app. Most of us downloaded it on the lift and had it running before we got off, which was awesome.

The developer does a great job of updating the app all the time, adding cool new features.  Half the reason I went skiing two days ago was just to see what was new this winter with Slopes!

False,This App is absolutely Wonderful,,enoughsev,5,First off I don't write reviews on apps. ever. However this app deserves it. It's stats I never knew I wanted but now can't ski without. It creates a competition to see who goes the fastest and who had the longest run or who waited in line the longest and who had the longest down hill. I now make it a goal to ski down as many different runs so my map looks cooler. It's an addiction that has now spread to all of my ski buddies. To the developer of this app. I love you for this.

Some major things to know that I really like:
-It automatically stops recording on the lift and resumes once you get off very accurately
-the app takes statistics from people who have gone before you and so you can see what the snow is like on the slopes before you get there.
- if you snowboard or ski a lot during the season the year premium pass is definitely worth the money if you are very competitive with friends or just like seeing what you‚Äôve done.

I am using an iPhone X and a Apple Watch series 5 with out cellular. I have tried all the tips that the developer says to do but my watch doesn‚Äôt last a whole day of riding when the app is running.

Unfortunately in a recent update the app changed the way it records that data into the Apple Activity all and Health App which now means some of your calories during skiing will be double counted. The reason this happens is because while the slopes app is continually recording health data, it is only reporting it to Apple Health every few minutes. This means that Apple is also counting other active calories between each of these data dumps. 

For example, I skied 3.5 hours today. Slopes says I burned 600 calories, which I believe. However, these calories weren't reported to Apple Health on the normal 3, 6, or 15 second internals, but rather every few minutes. This means Apple Health recorded additional (double counted) calories in between each report from Slopes. The result is that Apple Health and Activity believe I burned 950 calories. Absurd.

Really good features and pricing is fair. 

However with the latest app update, it seems to delete some of my runs randomly. I reviewed the top speed on my last run (which was recorded) on my watch and when I went back into app on the phone, the entire run was deleted. 

The same thing happened on the phone where I quit the app after reviewing a run and went back to it, the entire run is gone. 

Finally, and this could be an accidental press, I had stopped the recording on my watch after being done for the day. But, an hour long drive later, I realize that the watch was still recording and it captured my entire drive and said my top speed on that run was 65 mph! I thought it was smart enough to auto pause but something seem to have changed. 

Once these bugs are fixed, I don‚Äôt think any other apps will be able to compete with this one.",2021-01-19 05:17:37

A few times my watch has crashed on me when I go to save my day, but the app seems to save things as you go because I‚Äôve never lost anything when that happens.

My friends ask me after each run how fast we went and far while we‚Äôre on the lift and it‚Äôs a cool thing to know.

False,Great!,,David-23,5,"I got this app before skiing last week in Steamboat.  I loved it!  I used the watch app to record my day, and then the phone app to look at the data it collected.  Accurate and really interesting. I ended up sprinting for day passes for the days I skied, and would advise that for visualizing what you did, but even the free version is great. And when I had a small problem and emailed, customer service was great. My only wish is that there were an iPad version for looking at data after the fact.",2019-04-02 14:41:55

The features are great, the app never glitches on me, and the developer is an angel! Because of Apple and a mysterious glitch, I had to delete the app and lost all of my data.

False,Tried them all: I‚Äôm here to stay!,,Drizztar,5,"One of the reasons I justified buying myself an Apple Watch was to track my skiing adventures. I soon found out that the default apple apps are really inadequate; I wanted something as good or better than Strava is for running, but for skiing instead.

After a month or so of trying out all the iOS apps out there Slopes takes the cake. Especially this year with all the added features bringing Slopes in line with social media and photo integration tools like strava does. 

Everyone on Facebook noticed my awesome ski day summary photos, and live trail map photos and keep asking what app I use to make them! SLOPES PEOPLE! 

I easily buy the annual membership to support the dev and it has already paid off as features roll out consistently and the dev fixes bugs quick.

False,Great ski tracker,,ReiMirra,5,"I had been using strava in the past as the Stevens Pass app ate battery life and I didn‚Äôt like the other apps. 
This one is awesome. It tracks with my phone or watch. The timeline dot is awesome. I paid for a day pass curious to see what there was to know. It‚Äôs mostly accurate for Stevens Pass. It would be neat to have the heart rate match my Ski runs. And current weather for that day.
Update: 10/15 bought season pass. Has heart rate tracking or at least maybe have it trigger to sample on black diamond runs",2018-10-16 03:50:36

Unfortunately between both of us the app missed four of our runs. Not sure what the problem is. Just started it at the resort then went skiing.

The ‚ÄúSlopes and Your Data‚Äù section is a must read on the app as it is good- natured, witty and frankly the way most disclosures should read. 

Only issue I‚Äôve ever had was with North America‚Äôs sole indoor skiing facility in NJ: there was little to no connectivity (which was not Slopes fault whatsoever). My 20-something runs only registered as 1 run.

Also, there‚Äôs no option to export the data or save it to iCloud in case you done want it uploaded to the developer‚Äôs server but still want it backed up.

Apple Watch version isn‚Äôt any better and splits the key stats across 4 screens so a quick glance won‚Äôt work to get a quick sense of things. You have to rotate the crown to see those.

False,Great App for tracking your skiing,,Mark of The Mountain,5,This is a great app if you like to keep track of your ski days and your number of runs on each ski day. I like to do this. For fitness reasons I try to ski longer and get more runs in as the season progresses. The app also shows you visually each run and each lift ride it is customized to the resort that you enter and saves that resort until you change it. I don‚Äôt really care about seeing each run but it is still kind of cool that it can do that.,2018-02-22 00:53:08

One bug is that if you ride a tram down you get credit for an awesome run, haha. Interesting to see the stats for the tram though.

Our 3hr tour started with an approach to the bowl up a 500‚Äô vert skintrack over maybe 0.75mi. We then did 2 laps up another 750‚Äô face for some very nice powder sessions. Slopes ultimately said we climbed 380‚Äô for 1 lap taking 2H40m car-to-car.

Scrolling through the data, it looks like it captured our first ascent and descent, our second ascent and then must have died. My phone did die during the trip, so there must be a link between the two that maybe disrupted the data collection.

False,Great app,,MKellum1,5,"Tried this app after a friend recommended it to me, I really enjoyed it on my last trip.

False,Amazing App!,,ToxicAsh/ElaMain,5,"I first used the BBMR app (official app for Big Bear) and I realized that the speed tracking maxed out at 30MPH, as well as how it was a bit inaccurate.

False,Awesome,,JDubZ21,5,Was looking for another option other than Strava or Apple Watch workouts to record my runs. This app is so easy to use. Doesn‚Äôt kill my watch battery.

False,This is great,,Randomperson219,5,"This app works great. It doesn‚Äôt miss a single run and is really good at giving you your speed. I was supposed that I could go over 50mph on skis.

Easy to see how many runs I took.
Quick to see how each run went.
Quick to then break down the run to understand which portions were quick and slow.

Live that it knows which lift I‚Äôm taking and color codes the lift vs runs.

Also easy to fix mistakes like leaving my phone on while driving home.

At first I was unsure if I wanted to spend $20/yr for this app. But the design is so clean and it works so well. I also want the developer to maintain the app. Which isn‚Äôt a one time cost.

Developer is very responsive and kind. Thanks",2019-11-27 11:08:09

False,Brutal on battery life,,theMJF,3,"it‚Äôs a killer on battery life. Even in airplane mode.

A couple of things I noticed. After 12 runs I unlocked it to check my battery and it wasn‚Äôt running in the dock. I had to restart the app. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to keep in the dock. 

The other issue is I had to unlock my watch and when l looked for the app in the dock it wasn‚Äôt there so I had to restart it again.

I need to use two fingers to move around the map, and even that It barely moves me at all, and get get a bit fidgety when I try to zoom out and back in.

False,Simply the best ski app out there,,Marcam377,5,"I must first confess that I am a bit of ski nut. I have a demanding job and I travel a lot, so I don‚Äôt get to spend as much time as I would like on the slopes. But on the other hand, my travels allow me to experience different countries and snow conditions and I am always trying to squeeze in a day or two of skiing wherever I go. 
Slopes allows me to keep an exact track of the number of my sky days, and makes it easy to remember details about your day as it automatically uploads the pictures you took while out skiing, if you so desire. It also lists all the resorts you were in and shows you every run and lift you took, together with your verticals, max speed, and a bunch of data we skiers like to brag about. But the coolest feature and the conversation piece while enjoying apr√®s-ski is the ability to look at your day on a 3D model of the mountain you skied, and to ‚Äúdrop‚Äù it as an augmented reality piece on a table top, for all your friends to see through your phone screen as they walk around the table and see different angles of the AR mountain and your runs. It‚Äôs genius!
It works beautifully with my Apple Watch 4. You start the app at the beginning of the day and you don‚Äôt need to worry about it until you stop skiing. Of course you can easily pause it while having lunch so you keep you recording ‚Äúpure‚Äù. Finally, while the app runs all day while you are out on the slopes, it somehow does not deplete your battery. The drag on your juice is barely noticeable, and it will definitively leave you enough power to finish your day, brag about your skiing and then some! By the way, did I mention that it can automatically sync with Strava, so if you do other activities like running, swimming or cycling, your ski activity will sit nicely with your other training sessions. 
If I have a suggestion, it would be to add a measure of the steepest angle you skied during the day, as I have seen it on another ski app. 
This app has made my ski seasons even more enjoyable. I love it!",2019-04-06 09:57:10

False,Excellent app from an excellent developer!,,Lindzjay,5,"Wow!  Can I just say how impressed I am with my overall experience with this app and the developer!  I researched skiing apps before choosing this one and it has exceeded expectations!  
I bought the Season Pass last year but this year I was able to use the Family Season pass for such a great deal and my other family members were able use their own accounts.  This family pass option makes using slopes quite economical. (Even though I probably would‚Äôve purchased it for myself and my husband anyway because the added features with the Season Pass make it well worth it.). When I wasn‚Äôt sure how to get the family share set up for the rest of the family I sent off an email.  My emailed questions got a quick response from Curtis who walked me through what needed to be done.  We also had an issue setting up my daughter‚Äôs Slopes Pass on an older phone and once again I had a quick email back with the help I needed.  
I have been showing off my Slopes app to all my skiing/boarding friends and recommending it them.  Several have switch from other skiing apps because of the benefit of low battery usage and the fact that you can edit your ski day if you accidentally forget to turn it off. (Features not found on other apps.)
Skiing with Slopes has given my ski day an added element of fun.  Seeing the stats and speeds and being able to watch my whole ski day play out has been a hoot!  
I especially appreciate the remind feature that makes sure I don‚Äôt miss a ski day using my app.

False,Best app I‚Äôve found and responsive developer,,Bobby-hill,5,"I moved to CO having tried skiing a few times. I wanted to get better so that I could keep up with friends and to have more fun on the Mountain. I have tried a few different ski tracking apps but never found anything that tracked reliably until l switched to Slopes in 2016 and I have been pretty happy ever since!

I initially liked the ability to see the maps of my runs but quickly fell in love with all the other features. I have the Annual/Season Pass because I live in near many resorts and now ski 30+ times a season. I ski a few specific resorts more often, where I know the mountain quite well. When I was first learning the heat maps helped show me where I struggled and where I was more suited. The speed stat is one that is always fun to check out and compare to previous day or seasons runs. On occasion, I skied faster that day then the drive on I70...

My wife and I, and her father all learned together. The first seasons we were limited to beginner terrain and short days in uncomfortable boots and you can see how much our skill progressed via the maps showing all the runs and lifts we can cover on a mountain these days. The detailed 3D maps with real-time playback are awesome to share with friends or family and the stats and quick share options are easy to use. 

The app tracks perfectly on my IPhone 7+ and Apple Watch 3 (thanks to the developers quick support and responsive customer service) which is important to me because I am training for a half marathon and skiing is part of my training but at the time there were not many good tracking options that were reliable or didn‚Äôt kill my battery. I‚Äôve never had that problem with this app on my phone or watch, great battery life. For the Apple Watch, I recommend locking it while you track as it‚Äôs easy to accidentally pause it, but if you do the water lock, it will not pause (again I‚Äôve had exceptional battery life and not needed to pause it during the day) and you will be certain to capture your tracking. Cold weather kills tech, keep your Apple Products covered and warm and the battery last longer 

All the reminder features are lifesavers (well maybe that‚Äôs dramatic but at least day savers for someone who needs fitness tracking to count) for starting your day at your favorite mountains and after lunch or cocktail breaks.

I highly recommend this app! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, 5/5 dentist approve...(okay the dentist stat might be made up but the app is seriously great)",2019-04-13 06:00:10

False,Fantastic even though I‚Äôve only used it for a day,,Just frustrating to use,5,"Luckily, I stumbled across this app in the parking lot at Snowbird waiting on the lifts to open. After looking through a couple of list of best ski trackers. I picked this one. Mainly because it had great reviews and promised not to kill your phone‚Äôs battery. 

I didn‚Äôt really even think much about it. Just turned it on and forgot about it. So it ran in the background all day, open to close 9-4.

When I finished skiing I ended the session and started looking at the stats and maps of my runs. I have to say I was BLOWN AWAY with how much information was captured and offered to me. Even with only having the free version. 

For a entire day of skiing the battery only went down 30%. And that‚Äôs with me taking pictures, texting people, and generally not being afraid to use the phone. Not to mention being out in the cold. I had the phone in my ski shell pant pocket( ie no insulation).

This developer obviously knows what he is doing and many people can benefit from it. I only get to ski about a week a year. But going forward I plan on getting the premium package that best suits my needs and letting it rip. This is one of the few times where I want to pay for the best the app has to offer. Simply because it is so good in the free version. It must be bananas with what‚Äôs on tap with the premium. Not to mention I enjoyed sharing the information with friends and family and WANT to support the developer.

The app interface is only part of the experience though! This team has really done their work, everything runs perfectly on the WatchOS side. I feel comfortable leaving my phone in my backpack and recording with Siri commands on the watch microphone. Slopes also integrates amazingly with the base Apple systems: calories and HR information are viewable without the Health app, and I can even forward that information to third party apps without issue!

As a recent health nut, it‚Äôs amazing to have my daily recommended calories change based on a day of snowboarding!

When the app works on iPhone, it‚Äôs amazing. I walked through my brother‚Äôs runs with him this evening and we were able to pinpoint falls and changes in snow condition throughout the day it was so accurate (he was using the app without the watchOS companion). He‚Äôs got the iPhone 12 and the included AR is ROCK SOLID with a LIDAR sensor. I was able to trace his runs in real space with my finger on top of a virtual mountain. INCREDIBLE!!!

False,That's what I was looking for...for years.,,Kodilu,5,"As a skier, I find this to be the most complete and usefull App out there and I've tried many! Works great both for skiers and snowboarders. Absolutely no need to take your phone out of the pocket to pause activity on lifts, etc. It's 100% set-it-and-forget-it. What a time saver and mind reliever - just ski and enjoy your day. Don't thing about the activity tracking. It's being tracked and identified as skiing, resting, climbing with a lift. Plenty of current info's and stats on the Apple Watch. The ability to trim time is hugely useful: I forgot to stop recording at the end of the day and I drove for 45km. Then I just trimmed to the time when I left the parking and all data was adjusted. Many, many other usefull feature that I will not be able to detail here and now. But the best part is that the developer is dedicated to this project, he releases frequent updates, he is quick in replying and fixing bugs and I feel and believe that many great feature will come in the future. Some bugs and crashes do happen but it's a great work in progress overall. Bugs are smashed quickly. Thanks",2017-01-23 17:41:02
False,A Must-Have for the Slopes,,Matt_Milner,5,"This app is so awesome!

Just press Record and hit the slopes! Once you've completed a run, you can immediately view stats for that run while you're riding the lift up for the next one. This app tells you exactly what you want to know about your day on the slopes- top speed, peak altitude, longest run, and much more. At the end of the day you can view your stats from each run individually for comparison or just out of plain curiosity. There is even a feature that lets you view hundreds of data points taken during each run on a 3D map (including exactly where you hit your top speed during the run). Many of these features are basically unmatched by similar apps and you get almost every stat you can think of from your day on the mountain.

I also must say that the customer service for this app is phenomenal! If you ever have any issues or questions, you can expect a timely and thorough response, at least in my experience. 

This app is a must-have for the slopes. I've tried the other apps too, but this one is hands-down the best there is: Highly Recommended!",2016-01-30 04:35:18
False,Assumes Data Coverage,"{'id': 707, 'body': ""Once you've visited a resort once Slopes will cache that locally and default to that automatically going forward. The auto-selection can lead to a lot of mis-information (Ski Tracks pegs me at Spring Mountain when I start it ~10mi away at my house). SnoCru does the same. I've found this to be the best balance to make sure people who ride off-piste a lot aren't annoyed having to deselect a resort all the time. Gotta respect the backcountry riders!"", 'modified': '2017-03-27T19:20:55Z'}",Chaos215bar2,2,"This app seems good overall. I might have a higher opinion if I had tried the subscription options, but haven't done so due to the one major annoyance I have with this apps design. $8 per month or $20 per year is much too much to pay to try extra features on an app that isn't otherwise flawless.

The big problem I have is that I'm forced to select a resort before starting even though much of the time my only option is ""Off Piste"" due to lack of cell coverage. First, the location should simply default to ""Off Piste"" rather than forcing me to take needless extra steps to select that option (which is wrong anyway) when trying to start skiing. Second, would it really be so hard to include a resort database in the app? Ski areas frequently do not have good cell coverage, and including a mandatory first step that requires data to be useful before starting tracking is just silly. Ski Tracks has done this for years.",2016-01-13 18:50:03
False,Fantastic app! Tons of info and easy on battery life,,tee-ray,5,"I downloaded this at the start of the season, and it's been a ton of fun to see stats on my days out. The developer has put lots of thought into conserving your battery life while still getting *incredibly* detailed information on your runs. The Apple Watch app is superb as well, giving you great glance-able information while your phone is buried in your jacket. This is the one of the rare apps that I am thrilled to pay a subscription for since there is such care and thought into making a great user experience.

With 3D graphs and other cool features, other apps don't compare. The developers really want to make it the best riding experience so they listen to your feedback. It works very well on Apple Watch and is easy to use, lift your wrist and see your high speeds! I cannot explain how much there is to this app and how easy/fun it is to use on the mountain. This application knows what hill you are on so it knows when to stop recording when you are on the lift, saving battery life. Slopes is the best and I highly recommend it.",2016-03-05 02:35:27
False,Best skiing GPS app out there,,Eric Pelair,5,"After trying a handful of ski tracking apps, I believe this one is the best out there. The interface is clean and the GPS tracking has been very accurate in my experience. Although you don't get all of the data you'll want with the base version of the app, it is still enough to make me keep using it over the alternatives. I still haven't purchased the full version since I don't like the idea of paying a recurring fee. Hopefully the developer considers the option of paying one up-front cost to unlock the app permanently. Still think it is worthy of 5 stars.",2017-01-25 20:10:42

Wow, does it even knock the socks off Vail Resorts' app in many ways. The integration to social media with fun facts and personal statistics is a treat. Really though, top speed and ability to replay your ski day have the best 'ah ha' moments that just keep giving. The little things are taken into consideration here and pricing is so reasonable for the 2-5 ski day person or the 100 ski day person.

The app can compute speed and vertical gains and losses very accurately and record your top speed and where it happened. You can export your detailed track information in a variety of formats to open in Google Earth or similar and play back your day!

Love the top speed tracking and the run replays (would be nice to export run replay as a video!) amongst the many features as well as the intelligent lift/run detection.  

Others complaining here about 2$ a day for the advanced reporting pass are unappreciative of what an independent developer has to invest to build something so sophisticated.",2017-02-12 04:56:41

Great design, HealthKit integration, and works wonderfully WITHOUT an internet connection. The app tracked all my runs perfectly without me having to mess with my phone thanks to the Apple Watch app - almost like set it and forget it until you're done skiing. It could tell the difference between a run and the lift. Glancing at the watch screen showed me current stats - very cool and just what I was looking for. I highly recommend this app!",2017-01-11 01:18:05
False,Works Really Well!,,jrhoda1,4,"This app works really well. You turn it on and forget about it. Unfortunately there are a few problems I have with it. One is the limited ability to look at data. I would love to see all of my runs in a table view, breaking it down piece by piece. The horizontal timeline scroll method just doesn't give that kind of precision. Additionally, theres no way to change the map type. So all you have is the road map which is less than useful for skiing. Also, having a watch app complication would be really slick to quick check stats, recording state, etc.",2016-02-07 06:16:48
False,Adds great stats to a great sport!,,Tgrantphoto,5,I knew that some ski hills I rode at had faster lifts than others but I never knew how much faster.

Battery life only drained about 25% after a full (open to close) day of riding. That was with the app running and playing music! Glances on the watch work slick and keeps me having to pull my phone out all the time. Turn it on and go ride. No hassle app and works great!,2016-02-08 01:22:32
False,This app is awesome,,Who Mee,5,"Outstanding customer service for an app. Had a small issue getting the season pass. They were super responsive even on a weekend.

False,Great App; used all Winter all over Montana,,AaronMontana,5,"I love the app!  Fun way to track miles, vertical feet and calories over the Winter season.  The one problem, I tried beating my GS speed run after run, and this app may have convinced me to get a new set of sticks.  That certainly will cost more than the app.  Be nice if it had a magic battery, as using the GPS (in areas with no cell signal) does run it down quickly.  I like the feature to auto add photos taken during the day to the album for the day‚Äôs runs.",2015-04-14 14:33:04
False,Really Awesome!,,CleoAppMan,5,"I got this app because I got an Apple Watch for Christmas and was already an avid activity tracker using Digifit with my iPhone.

The visualization of a day's skiing along with the ability to leave personal notes about conditions, people you ski with, etc. makes this an ideal tool for ensuring memories of those great days on the mountain can be retained for years!

False,Paid Version A Big Waste,,Alison Marie 27,2,"I use this app all the time as I snowboard 2-4 times per week. It's great to record each day, and see statistics. However, I haven't a clue what the ""subscription"" is for - I thought it would allow me to edit if there was an accidental run entry (i.e., driving and having it say your highest speed was 80mph). It doesn't really do the trail and lift thing very well at all. It needs another page with statistics and totals and records, etc. To find my highest speed of the season, I have to go through each of my 30 days. It's good for recording speeds and miles and such, don't get me wrong, but go donate your money to a good cause instead of this scam!",2016-03-14 04:38:37
False,What an awesome product,,Snap_dragon,5,"This app is essential for snow activities!  It tracks the number of runs I take, my top speed, elevation, and calories consumed.

The premium version is a bit expensive, but even with just the free version, this is still my favorite snow tracking app.",2017-01-05 22:56:56

This app has it all - a nifty watch app, run playbacks and statistics (with a map no less) and even health tracking. It sounds awesome.

Unfortunately whenever I tell Slopes to start recording my runs, it does so for (maybe) a few runs and then stops recording entirely. I have to keep telling it to start recording at the beginning of each run sometimes, and even then it cuts out halfway through. This happens on multiple phones with good GPS signal too.

As such, I really want to like this app (especially as a season pass holder), but not catching my data is a pretty significant bummer for me.",2017-02-05 18:31:24

Worked without a single hitch.  I do, however, suspect that the speedometer is sometimes a little off.  It says that I peaked out on my second run, which was only a mid-level trail.  I know that I went faster on some of the diamond trails later in the day.

False,Subscription misleading and too expensive,,appleguru,1,"Feels like I got swindled.

First ski day gives you all the cool 3D maps, pre run stats, etc. Nowhere is it clearly indicated which features are ""premium features"" that require the VERY expensive subscription that can't even be shared with Family Members (in app purchases don't share with family sharing).

Used the app for a second day of skiing; was all excited to show off my runs to my friends only to learn that all the per run info was not available. All you get is a nearly useless ""high level"" summary of your day.

False,Fantastic App!! Simply Brilliant!!,,Paulo-US,5,"I use the app for snowboarding.

In all honesty I did not expect such an incredible app, for free especially.

It‚Äôs smart enough to know when you are skiing, on a lift, or waiting in line/at the lodge so you don‚Äôt even have to pause it you stop for lunch.

Honestly, this app is what is keeping me from switching from an iPhone to a Pixel or other Android device; I can‚Äôt imagine skiing without it and think the premium pass is well worth it!

False,Wow - Serious Apple Watch Love,,Positive Vibrations,5,"Slopes + AW is mind blowing good. I have been recording skiing with Garmin GPS watches for the past decade and tried slopes last season as an experiment. Now for 2019/2020 I am all in on Slopes! Here is why...

Slopes is smart. I can start recording on my Apple Watch when getting my gear on in the parking lot. It knows I am walking to the lifts and then starts my day automatically when I board the lift or I start skiing (if the parking lot is mid-mountain).

Slopes is accurate. I record with my iPhone in the chest pocket of my jacket and always start/end the day‚Äôs recording on my AW. This gives me credit for the activity on the AW and also creates a skiing workout within Apple‚Äôs Activity app. Plus it does this with all day battery life on both devices!

Slopes is well made. The developer has been hard at work making the app better. Bugs are few and get squashed quickly. New features are added often. Props to the developer!

Slopes rocks on AW! This is the only non-native app I have used on my Apple Watch that isn‚Äôt garbage. It is solid, reliable and feature rich. 

As you can tell I‚Äôm stoked! Slopes can satisfy a full fledged GPS nerd.",2019-12-22 17:21:43
False,Enjoyable and useful ski tracker,,Marcin,5,"I have been using Slopes since the 2016-2017 winter season. My primary resort is Mammoth Mountain. 

I enjoy how well Slopes tracks all the lifts I take and trails I ride. It‚Äôs actually surprisingly very accurate. 

I enjoy being able to scroll through my run history with the map animating as I scroll past the day‚Äôs runs.

I like the stats Slopes provides and now I am able to link up with friends to see their progress along with my own ‚Äî a fantastic feature.

My only current question is whether the top speed and average speed of a particular run are accurate. I a friend claimed that his physical tracker stated he went faster than Slopes recorded. For years, my average speed has been nearly the same. That may be because I am more cautious rider, but I am curious if the speeds are accurate.

Either way, I enjoy the app. The price for passes is very reasonable for what you receive!",2019-12-17 20:08:56
False,Rad App With Integrity,,jmc1976,5,"‚ÄúSlopes and Your Data

I don't want to do anything creepy with your data. I charge users directly for Slopes Passes so I can avoid having to sell your data or do anything else questionable to make money and stay in business. I may use some of your data responsibly to improve Slopes, but that's it.

I do occasionally advertise Slopes on Instagram, so I have the Facebook advertising SDK (code library) in Slopes which is pseudonymous. I do not share any data you enter into or capture with Slopes with Facebook; it is only used to track how many installs come from Instagram ads so they can accurately charge me. Removed in 2019.12, because Facebook is creepy and can't be trusted.‚Äù

False,Good app,,Skimunk,5,"Seems to work as intended, like that I can keep track of my runs,  I really like the 3D map function and how you can send it to your friends while they are sitting in their cubicles and you are skiing.",2019-12-04 17:17:46

That said, with the advent of the new ‚Äúfriends‚Äù feature I can already see where the thoughtfulness breaks down...Much like I don‚Äôt talk politics on the lift, I don‚Äôt ask what type of devices my fellow snow riders use. It‚Äôs a personal thing and not worth the debates that ensue. That said though, I KNOW that not all, if not most, of my extended snow crew is not on an iPhone and thus can‚Äôt get in on the epicness that is this app no less the friends feature and thus would split my crew into the ‚Äúhaves‚Äù and ‚Äúhave nots‚Äù.

False,Best ski app,,Woodinville cyclist,5,"My family are avid skiers.  To put in perspective we had 50 days on the mountain this season. I used Trace Snow for a few years which I quite liked but they have not updated their app in a few years. I‚Äôve also used Snoww and Ski Tracks. None of the above apps really satisfied me and they either didn‚Äôt have an Apple Watch version or it was poorly executed.  I used Slopes the entire 2018-2019 season.  I used it exclusively from my Apple Watch and had it synch to Strava.  The app is simple, the execution is the best I‚Äôve used.  The other thing I like about Slopes is there are frequent updates with enhancements, user experience updates, etc.  For those who are serious about their winter mountain sports I highly recommend.",2019-04-01 15:32:45

False,Best option out there,,FOTOPNATION,5,"After two years of using it, and countless days logged.. (actually I know exactly how many thanks to Slopes!) I have decided to write a review.

To anyone contemplating which app to get for tracking their runs, this is it right here. I‚Äôm using an older iPhone, and never notice any significant battery drain. I also use my Spotify on my phone to listen to music while I ski and after a full day of skiing 8:30am-4pm, I‚Äôm still at ~50% battery life.

The stats tracking is awesome, the 3D-modeling of your runs is an epic feature. All in all, a very well crafted and curated app.",2019-02-26 17:07:02

The watch app is a little buggy so I generally use just the phone app, as I have my phone with me usually anyway. My biggest issue, however, is that my first run of the 2018-2019 season is showing up as a continuation of my last run in the 2017-2018 season. I know I ended the last run of last season and I know I started a new day in the current season, but it show up as one day that lasted over 5000 hours. I emailed support and never got a response.

False,The best,,rleebond,5,"This is absolutely the best skiing/snowboarding tracking app out there. They are constantly making it better too.

False,Great Idea Bad Business Model,,Kane KS,1,It seems ridiculous to me that an app like this is subscription based for full access.  What makes it worse are the prices.  I can‚Äôt believe that people are paying $19.99 a year to essentially use a GPS tracker.,2018-01-12 23:57:11

False,Great Analytics and Data Display,,Jaminin19,4,This app has amazing analytics and I cannot believe the size of the app! You must have some pretty solid developers. The only suggestion that I have is modify your pricing. I would be more that willing to pay around $9.99 to unlock all the features of the app (Slope Pass). But I would only want to pay that price once. I only go about 10-20 time per season and then that's it until next season. So the 19.99/year doesn't justify the extra feature for me. Love the app though!,2016-12-30 04:50:26
False,Awesome app.,,mcvayc01,4,This app is awesome at tracking your skiing or snowboarding. Integrates well with Apple health app. Well worth the season pass for $19.95.,2016-11-22 19:55:02
False,Amazing,,Loyal pandora user,5,Amazing,2016-01-23 15:36:05
False,Excellent app with incredible developer support,,Boaz13,5,"When I initially considered the cost of an annual pass for Slopes, I wasn‚Äôt sure that it would be worth it. I gave it a try, though, and have been super happy with it all season long. 

An app update at the end of the season caused an issue syncing between my watch and my phone but the developers made sure that the problem was fixed and my data was saved.

Pros: 
I can get a full 8 hours of downhill snowboarding in on a single Apple Watch charge. On days where I go longer than that, I can pick up recording on my phone as the watch dies and Slopes will merge the recordings. 
The integration with Strava is great.
The recording crop tool in the app is intuitive and convenient.
Costs about the same as two resort beers. 

Cons: 
The season is almost over!
